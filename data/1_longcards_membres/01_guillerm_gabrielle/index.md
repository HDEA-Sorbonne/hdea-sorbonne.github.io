## Thèmes de recherche

Gabrielle Guillerm is Associate Professor of American and US history. She specializes in the intersection of religion and race in America. Her current book project, based on her dissertation, explores the role of French Catholic missionaries in entrenching white supremacy in the Midwest after the American Revolution. In 2022-2024, she worked as the researcher coordinator for a project that seeks to confront the history and legacy of a Catholic boarding school meant to assimilate Lakota children of the Pine Ridge reservation (South Dakota) to white Christian culture. 

## Research Topics:

- Native American and Indigenous Studies (especially the history of colonialism and settler colonialism in Early America and the United States & the history and legacy of Native American boarding schools). 
- U.S. Westward Expansion
- White supremacy
- Religious history
- Early America (especially 1763-1860) and the Age of Revolutions
